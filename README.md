# MyE-MailApp

## General info
Simple project of an e-mail client application. I made it to easly download, manage text and attachments from gmail (plan to add other options). To work properly you need to enable "access to less secure apps" on your gmail account.

## Features
* Log in with your gmail account and download mails with attachments
* Browse downloaded mails
* Text an attachments are stored in folders and can be accessed by double-clicking(which open system file explorer)
* Read e-mail content and view pictures by double-clicking on them

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java SE
* JavaMail 1.4
* Java Gmail Imap 1.4.4

## Installation
1. Method: Clone this repo to your local machine. All the code is required to get started. 
2. Method: If you just want to use an application download "MyEmailApp.zip". Then extract it in desired directory and run "My E-mail App.exe" (Java RE 1.8.0_251 is recommended).
